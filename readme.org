* types.el
This library lets you define typed functions in elisp without having to use +CLOS+ [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eieio.html][EIEIO]] or manually check the types yourself.

* Example
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'types)

  (define-typed-function foo (numberp x)
    (* x x))

  (foo 15) ;; results in 255
  (foo "bad input") ;; results in error "Expected numberp for argument 1"
#+END_SRC
